My love,

What a great start it was — for the second year of our love 🤍

The letter I wrote for our first year made you so happy, much more than I ever imagined. I never thought you would be in such a happy mood. I actually had another gift planned for you, but I couldn't make it happen, so I made that letter as a gift. Thanks to my lack of resources 😅.

That gift made me think of writing more letters. It helped me improve my English, develop webpages, and understand that investing time in something meaningful is never a waste. Most importantly, it made you happier than I expected — and that means everything to me 💖.

Okay, now let me talk about this special day.

We were in such a happy mood, and sadly, we slept in different houses 😭 (It should have been together). Even though we had only one class at 10, you came at 9 just for me. You were wearing a black top, even though I had told you to wear a shirt for that day — and I was dressed completely in blacks 🖤.

You were in Classroom 109. Sorry I came late, but I never disappointed you. I hugged you from behind and kissed you so much. Thank you for the kisses — but honestly, it was not enough. We had so much to celebrate, and sadly, we didn't have a proper place 🫠.

Do you remember what your eyes saw? 👀
Do you remember what your hands were holding?
Do you remember what your lips touched?
Do you remember what your tongue tasted?
Do you remember what your teeth did?

Wow… it was such a good kiss — and not the only one. It was our first time for lips. Thank you so much for that 🤍.

Do you remember how I kissed all over your face, your hands, your palm, your fingers, your feet?
You are my princess 👑.

After some time, we went to attend the class. Even though my friends were around me, laughing and teasing the teacher, and even though the teacher was teaching, the only thing I kept thinking about was you and what we had done for the first time.

After the class, we went for a long walk to a small café called Haus of Desserts. Our walks are never boring because we talk about everything — about dreams, family, future. I personally enjoy walking with you more than anything 🚶‍♂️🚶‍♀️.

Even though the café was 2.2 km away, and even though you were on your periods, it never felt difficult. It was such a comfortable and enjoyable walk with you 🤍.

Finally, we reached the café. We first planned to have something spicy, so we ordered Creamy Red Sauce Pasta and a Cheese Corn Sandwich. They took a long time to serve the food.

That day, I actually liked the pasta. It was good — more Italian, but adjusted for Indian taste. It was very creamy and felt great. The main reason was that you were feeding me 😌. Thank you for that. But the problem is, when you feed me, you don't eat properly 😠😠 — so I think I need to make some rules.

Then came the sandwich. To reduce the waiting time, before finishing the food, we ordered Dark Waffle and Hot Brownie with Hot Chocolate Fudge 🍫.

The sandwich was okay — not the best I've had — but the special thing was that you were feeding me, and that's all that matters.

When it comes to sweets, both the waffle and the brownie were really good. And yes, the thing you found out that day is true 😄 — I love chocolate more than you do 🍫.

Thank you so much for such a beautiful date, my darling. It was the first time we spent that much money on a single date, and it was totally worth it 💕.

Then we took the bus to RR Gate from RR Temple. I came with you in the metro up to Cubbon Park for just ₹10 — that's how I always come with you in the metro.

We talked a lot in the metro about what we did in the classroom. I think I asked you to explain it more than a hundred times because it was short and so sweet. And the same thing continued on calls until you reached home.

I wanted to text you the whole evening and night until you slept. My friends dragged me to a movie, but still, I texted you from 11:15 PM to 1:00 AM, talking about our past and about the day 🤍.

This was the cutest and best celebration of our first year of love.
Truly the best day of 2025 for me.

Thank you for everything. Without your efforts, it wouldn't have been such a beautiful day. Even though you were on your periods, you gave your best to make this day special 🤍.

We missed 😢 visiting the temple because of that — next time, we will definitely go.

Thank you so much, my wife.
You are only mine.

I love you so much, my darling 💖.

Please promise me one thing —
you will never leave me alone in this world 🤍.
