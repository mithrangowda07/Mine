Happy birthday my love !!! ❤️
I hope you have a wonderful birthday and a great year ahead !!
I also hope you had a good last year ( fingers crossed)
I regret bringing you to tears last time ..... Hopefully I can make it up this year
I promise you that I would never leave you alone in this world..
And I hope you know how much you mean to me
And how greatful I am for your existence..
The past year has been the best I hv lived ..Thanks to you
You make everything easier and sweeter
And somehow you make me worry less about things..
Im sorry for all I had put you through and thank you for waiting
Maybe I'm repeating things I put in those stars
But I mean all of them from the bottom of my heart
I really wish I don't cause you any more tears ..
I wish you all the happiness in the world ( honestly you are the one who made me go to temples and the one I pray about)
You have been so nice to me
Never let me feel alone
Never made me feel lonely or unappreciated
Thanking you is the least I can do
You mean everything to me
My safe place
You are someone who I don't have to put up filters or masks ( you always were)
You have always been yout true self too...never hid things..never let me have a wrong impression..
I had no idea about how relationships should be ... thankyou for being patient and letting me realise wht it is and what it can be..
Thankyou so much for not giving up on me
And loads of love to you ❤️❤️❤️
I'm not as poetic as you are
Never written huge messages
Hopefully it gets better
Happy Birthday again!!!!
You are 21 (old 😂)
I love you soo much ❤️
I love you more than you think!! ❤️

Promise me tht you will always stay
