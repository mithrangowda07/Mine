            </div>

            <div class="letter-content">
                <p>My love,</p>

                <p>Today marks <strong>one year of being together</strong>, and I want to tell you everything from my heart — just like I feel it, just like it happened.</p>

                <p>I first started liking you on the day <strong>you slept on my shoulder without asking my permission</strong>. After you woke up, you smiled and asked, <em>"You don't have any problem, right?"</em></p>

                <p>From that very day, you became <strong>my crush, my princess, my everything</strong>.</p>

                <p>The way you love me,<br>
                the way you care for me,<br>
                the way you talk,<br>
                the way you ask about my family,<br>
                the way you listen to me —<br>
                slowly, without even realizing it, <strong>I fell deeply in love with you</strong>.</p>

                <p>The main reason I fell for you is <strong>how much you care</strong> and how <strong>sensitive</strong> you are. Your strict family made me understand that I need to give you time. That is how we moved from friends, to close friends, and then I completely fell for you.</p>

                <p>Small things mattered the most to me —<br>
                you sharing the food you brought from home,<br>
                asking me to stay back during lunch so we could eat together.<br>
                All these moments made me feel like <strong>you were my dream girl</strong>.</p>

                <p>I will never forget the <strong>first time I saw you in a saree</strong>, on <strong>Kannada Habba – 20/06/2024</strong>.</p>

                <p>That day, I truly felt like I was always with an angel.</p>

                <p>Your <strong>bright eyes</strong>,<br>
                your <strong>rounded cheeks</strong>,<br>
                your <strong>happy smile</strong>,<br>
                the <strong>maroon saree</strong>,<br>
                your <strong>long hair</strong> —<br>
                everything made me feel complete.</p>

                <p>When you came out of the <strong>ISE department</strong>, I had butterflies the entire day. Even though I didn't tell you that I loved you, that day was perfect. You wanted your photos, but all I wanted was <strong>photos of us together</strong>.</p>

                <p>Then came the painful time.</p>

                <p>I told you that I had feelings for someone and asked you to guess. You named everyone — <strong>but not yourself</strong>. That disappointed me so much.</p>

                <p>Finally, the day came when I had to tell you the truth — <strong>you were the one I loved</strong>. With strong suggestions from Meghana and some boost from her, I told you at the <strong>same place</strong>, do you remember? In the <strong>Telecommunication department</strong>, where I had earlier asked you to search for the girl I loved.</p>

                <p>I told you everything… but you didn't accept me.</p>

                <p>You said you could do anything else, but not this.</p>

                <p>But I needed <em>you</em>.</p>

                <p>I even came by metro just hoping you would accept me. I paid a <strong>₹100 fine</strong>, but still, you didn't accept me.</p>

                <p>Those were very long days for me. I cried so much, but every time the answer was the same.</p>

                <p>Then you told me you would <strong>search for a girl for me</strong> — but you never found one.</p>

                <p>Meanwhile, the bonding between us kept growing stronger and stronger.</p>

                <p>Every time I asked about a relationship, you were scared — scared of men, scared of what was happening in your family. I could feel that you liked me, but society and what you had seen made you reject me.</p>

                <p>Still, <strong>I stayed</strong>.</p>

                <p>I stayed until the day you could accept me.</p>

                <p>Then came our <strong>first date</strong> — <strong>24/12/2024</strong>, at <strong>Gopalan Arcade Mall</strong>, McDonald's.</p>

                <p>The intention was to shop for a shirt for my upcoming birthday. I don't know how to shop, so you decided everything. You took me to McDonald's, and we ate burgers together.</p>

                <p>That was the <strong>first time I went on a date with a girl</strong>, sitting beside you. Looking at your face while eating the burger you fed me made me fall in love with you even more.</p>

                <p>Shopping was average — because I don't know how to shop, and you didn't know how to select a shirt for <em>your boy</em>.</p>

                <p>Still, it was a <strong>beautiful day</strong> in my life.</p>

                <p>Then came another important day.</p>

                <p>Meghana was depressed because of something related to her crush. We spoke for two hours, and that conversation made me realize that I was wasting my time on you without studying, and you were also not getting close to me.</p>

                <p>So I decided — and I told Meghana — that I would ask you <strong>one last time</strong> about a relationship. If you said no, I would stop talking to you.</p>

                <p>The next day, you and I were in <strong>Classroom 109</strong>. I told you everything I had decided the previous night. Meghana interrupted us, so we went to the <strong>library</strong>.</p>

                <p>There came the twist.</p>

                <p>After <strong>six months of waiting</strong>, you finally said, <em>"I will think."</em></p>

                <p>That single sentence meant everything to me.</p>

                <p>Even though I was the reason you slept peacefully, you took six months to realize that you were in love with me. Still, you asked for a few days — and I waited.</p>

                <p>Then came <strong>New Year and my birthday — 01/01/2025</strong>.</p>

                <p>I wore the shirt you selected. We went to <strong>RR Temple</strong> with your friends and celebrated with cake cutting. Later, it was just you and me in <strong>Classroom 110</strong>.</p>

                <p>I told you <em>"I love you"</em>, but you didn't say it back. You asked for more time.</p>

                <p>But here comes the twist, madam.</p>

                <p>You sat on my lap and <strong>kissed my forehead</strong>. Do you remember?</p>

                <p>And I kissed you too.</p>

                <p>That was the moment I knew — <strong>you would accept me</strong>.</p>

                <p>Even though I cried on my birthday, having <em>you</em> made me so happy. That same day, I told Meghana everything that happened in the classroom because I couldn't hold it in anymore — <strong>you were finally mine</strong>.</p>

                <p>Wait… did I miss something?</p>

                <p>Yes — December.</p>

                <p>Do you remember, naughty girl?</p>

                <p>You allowed me to bite your cheek,<br>
                you slept on my lap,<br>
                we took photos sitting beside each other,<br>
                we hugged so much.</p>

                <p>Do you really think all that was <em>just friendship</em>?</p>

                <p>Finally, the day came when you accepted me.</p>

                <p>But before that, the night before, I was sad — because you still hadn't said <em>"I love you too."</em> You told me to ask the next day.</p>

                <p>So I took a <strong>Dairy Milk chocolate</strong> and in the same <strong>Classroom 110</strong>, I said <em>"I love you."</em></p>

                <p>And finally, you said it back — <em>"I love you too."</em></p>

                <p>Within seconds, you got a kiss on your cheek.</p>

                <p>Finally, I got you <strong>permanently</strong>.</p>

                <p>The sad part?</p>

                <p>We don't even know the exact date.</p>

                <p>Then our real story began.</p>

                <p>So many days together —<br>
                again Gopalan Arcade Mall,<br>
                Nayandahalli Mall (first time 🫣🫣 you know it),<br>
                Orion Mall,<br>
                Mantri Square,<br>
                Malleshwaram,<br>
                walks in RR Nagar,<br>
                so many visits to RR Temple (I think this temple made us be together).</p>

                <p>Random walks, me making you bunk classes just so we could spend time together.</p>

                <p>After all this, I took you to another city — <strong>Ramadevara Betta</strong>.</p>

                <p>It was a beautiful day for both of us. You sat on my lap the entire car journey.</p>

                <p>I really love talking to you.</p>

                <p>You make me feel like <strong>home</strong>.</p>

                <p>You are the <strong>best person I have ever met</strong>.</p>

                <p>Even though we fight a lot, we never take it to tomorrow or involve anyone else. That is the best thing about us — please keep it that way.</p>

                <p>I truly believe <strong>we will marry soon</strong>.</p>

                <p>Those long night talks at your grandmother's house, long walks, our promises to each other — everything is very special to me. I believe we will keep our promises until our last moment.</p>

                <p>We have memories in every place we visited, even though we have no photos.</p>

                <p>On another day, when you were wearing a <strong>black saree</strong>, I kept telling you about your <strong>waist the whole day</strong> — do you remember?</p>

                <p>Do you remember that <strong>I bought you bangles</strong>?</p>

                <p>Do you remember <strong>where I kissed you that day</strong>?</p>

                <p>Even though <strong>our photo could be my wallpaper</strong>, I can't do that until <strong>I get placed</strong>.</p>

                <p>We will <strong>study together</strong>, get a <strong>good placement</strong>, and then <strong>let our parents arrange our marriage</strong>.</p>

                <p>You took time to decide, but you made the decision before I gave up — <strong>thank you for that</strong>.</p>

                <p>Tomorrow is <strong>24th December</strong> — one year of being together. It never felt like one year. What a wonderful year it has been. You made it perfect.</p>

                <p>Even though I've shared so much about before you accepted me, after that… there is a whole universe of love I still cannot express.</p>

                <p>I Know that I have made mistakes, but I have learned from them and I will never make the same mistake again.</p>

                <p>I know that I have missed a lot of things to say here, but you may know them better than me or I will tell you in some other way.</p>

                <p>I never had a dream girl — <strong>you became my dream girl</strong> and my upcoming wife (too soon…).</p>

                <p>I love you so much.</p>

                <p>You are my princess.<br>
                You are my dream.<br>
                You are my sweetheart.<br>
                You are my darling.<br>
                You are my past.<br>
                You are my present.<br>
                You are my future.<br>
                You are my lady.<br>
                You are my family.<br>
                And you are only mine.</p>

                <p>I love you so much.</p>

                <p>Very happy for one year together.</p>

                <p>Please promise me one thing —</p>

                <p><strong>You will never leave me alone in this world.</strong></p>
